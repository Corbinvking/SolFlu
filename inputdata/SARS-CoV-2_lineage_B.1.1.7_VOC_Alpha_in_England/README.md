The B.1.1.7_England.single.tree file from the original study of Kraemer et al. (Spatiotemporal invasion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 emergence, Science, 2021) is not a maximum clade credibility (MCC) file (from TreeAnnotator), due to difficulties creating such an MCC file as a result of the very large data set size. The .trees file that was generated by BEAST 1.10.5 was trimmed to only contain the final tree from the posterior exploration analysis.  
The TreeTime_270221.csv file is an analysis result from the original study and accessible on the following GitHub repository:
