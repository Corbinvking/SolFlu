The B.1.1.7_England.single.tree file from the original study of Kraemer et al. (Spatiotemporal invasion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 emergence, Science, 2021) is not a maximum clade credibility file, due to difficulties creating such an MCC file as a result of the very large data set size. The .trees file that was generated by BEAST 1.10.5 only contains the final tree from the posterior exploration analysis.
